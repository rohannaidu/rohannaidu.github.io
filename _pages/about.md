Iâ€™m a final-year Ph.D. student advised by <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/cconroy" target="_blank">Prof. Charlie Conroy</a>. My thesis is focused on identifying and understanding the immigrant galaxies the Milky Way has assimilated ("Galactic Archaeology") using the <a href="http://h3survey.rc.fas.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">H3 Survey</a> and <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia" target="_blank">Gaia</a> satellite. I also work on the origins of the very first galaxies ("Cosmic Dawn") and how/when they ionized the Universe ("Cosmic Reionization") with my undergrad adviser <a href="https://obswww.unige.ch/~oeschp/" target="_blank">Prof. Pascal Oesch</a>. I will be among the first users of the  <a href="https://www.jwst.nasa.gov/" target="_blank">James Webb Space Telescope</a> via two PI and two Co-I Cycle 1 programs.

I grew up in Hyderabad, India (for a recent review, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWNV82AqFoE" target="_blank">see</a>). In a Bollywood-esque plot twist, at age 18 I dropped out of engineering school, bought my first-ever plane ticket, and joined the founding class of 150 students at <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/about/vision-and-mission/" target="_blank">Yale-NUS College</a>, Singapore (<a href="https://harvardmagazine.com/2017/07/an-educated-core" target="_blank">"Asia's first liberal arts college"</a>). Amidst <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/10-may-2016-a-love-affair-with-trivia/">my</a> <a href="https://yaledailynews.com/blog/2015/09/16/y-nus-students-create-elections-survey/" target="_blank">many</a> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yalenuscollege/p/BK5xNvcj6u6/?hl=en" target="_blank">Yale-NUS</a> <a href="https://www.yale-nus.edu.sg/newsroom/20-may-2015-singaporean-poet-alvin-pang-teaches-at-yale-nus/" target="_blank">adventures</a>, I discovered the joys of Astronomy working with <a href="http://www.astro.yale.edu/bailyn/" target="_blank">Prof. Charles Bailyn</a>, and as an exchange student with <a href="https://www.stsci.edu/~imomcheva/" target="_blank">Dr. Iva Momcheva</a> in the <a href="https://www.pietervandokkum.com/" target="_blank">van Dokkum</a> group at Yale.

My name is pronounced Rohan (rho, like the Greek letter + hon, like short for "honey") Naidu (Nye, like Bill Nye the Science Guy + Doo, like Scooby-Doo).
